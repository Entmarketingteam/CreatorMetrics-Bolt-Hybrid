# CreatorMetrics (Bolt Hackathon MVP)

CreatorMetrics is a full-funnel analytics and agentic co-pilot for creators.

It connects Instagram, LTK, and Amazon performance into a single dashboard and offers AI agents
that help you interpret the data, clean it, and generate creative.

## Quickstart

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open:

- `/dashboard`
- `/creators`
- `/campaigns`
- `/agents`
- `/upload`
