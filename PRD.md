# CreatorMetrics – PRD (Bolt Hackathon)

## Overview

CreatorMetrics is a full-funnel analytics and agentic co-pilot for creators and their managers.
It stitches together Instagram, LTK, and Amazon data into a single view and lets AI agents help
explain performance and suggest actions.

This MVP is implemented as a Next.js App Router project that is Bolt-friendly.
